# ADVANCED CODE DOCUMENTATION: LINEAR ALGEBRA & STATISTICS CALCULATOR (DECIMAL VERSION)

This document provides a comprehensive technical breakdown of every function used in this project. The calculator is built to handle both complex Linear Algebra and common Statistical operations using high-precision decimal (`double`) arithmetic.

---

## 1. FLOATING POINT STABILITY: EPSILON
Since computers cannot represent all decimal numbers perfectly (e.g., 0.1), we use a very small value called `EPSILON` (1e-9) to check if a number is "close enough" to zero.

- **Purpose**: Prevents errors where a value like `0.0000000000000001` is treated as a non-zero number, which would break algorithms like RREF or Inverse.
- **Usage**: Used in pivot selection and rank calculation: `if (std::abs(value) < EPSILON) // treat as zero`.

## 2. LINEAR ALGEBRA: Matrix.cpp / Matrix.h
The `Matrix` class uses a `std::vector<std::vector<double>>` to store data.

### `operator+` and `operator-` (Addition/Subtraction)
- **Logic**: Performs standard element-wise addition/subtraction.
- **Constraint**: Throws an error if matrix dimensions don't match.

### `operator*` (Multiplication)
- **Logic**: Standard dot product: `Result[i][j] = Sum(A[i][k] * B[k][j])`.
- **Complexity**: O(n³) operations.

### `transpose()`
- **Logic**: Switches rows with columns. `Result[j][i] = Original[i][j]`.

### `ref()` (Row Echelon Form)
- **Logic**: Uses **Gaussian Elimination**.
- **Steps**:
  1. Find a pivot (non-zero element, `> EPSILON`) in the current column.
  2. Swap rows if necessary to bring the pivot to the diagonal.
  3. Use row operations to clear all elements below the pivot.

### `rref()` (Reduced Row Echelon Form)
- **Logic**: Extends the `ref()` logic to clear elements *above* the pivots and normalize pivot values to `1.0`.
- **Cleanup**: After calculation, any values extremely close to zero are explicitly set to `0.0` to ensure clean output.

### `determinant()`
- **Logic**: Calculated using expansion by minors for small matrices and triangular reduction for larger ones.
- **Stability**: Elements are handled as `double` for precision across several operations.

### `inverse()`
- **Logic**: Uses the **Gauss-Jordan Method** on an augmented matrix `[A | I]`.
- **Singularity Check**: If `abs(determinant) < EPSILON`, the matrix is marked as singular and can't be inverted.

### `eigenvalues()`
- **Logic**:
  - **2x2**: Solves the characteristic quadratic equation `λ² - trace(A)λ + det(A) = 0`.
  - **Larger**: Uses the **QR Algorithm** (30 iterations) to converge the matrix into a form where eigenvalues appear on the diagonal.

## 3. STATISTICS: Statistics.h
Utility class providing standard descriptive statistics.

### `calculateMean()`
- **Logic**: Basic average: `Σx / n`.

### `calculateVariance()`
- **Logic**: Calculates **Sample Variance** (n-1 correction).
- **Formula**: `Σ(x - Mean)² / (n - 1)`.

### `calculateStandardDeviation()`
- **Logic**: Square root of the Variance.

---

## 4. UI & LOGIC: main.cpp

### `inputMatrix()`
- **Logic**: Reads decimal values directly from the user. It includes error handling to clear the input buffer if a non-numeric character is entered.

### `outputFormatting`
- **Logic**: All results are displayed using `std::fixed` and `std::setprecision(4)` to provide a clean, professional "financial-style" readout.

### `menuRouting`
- **Logic**: Provides separate access to Linear Algebra and Statistical tools, allowing users to extract rows or columns for quick data analysis.
