       PRESENTATION SCRIPT — Matrix Addition & Subtraction
================================================================================


----- 1. INTRODUCTION -----

Assalamu Alaikum / Good morning everyone,

Today we are presenting our C++ project — a Linear Algebra Calculator.
This calculator can perform several matrix operations such as Addition,
Subtraction, Multiplication, Determinant, Inverse, Transpose,
and Trace, all up to 5×5 matrices with high-precision decimal output.

For this demonstration, we will focus specifically on
Matrix Addition and Matrix Subtraction.


----- 2. CONCEPT -----

Matrix Addition:
  - Two matrices A and B can be added only if they have the SAME dimensions
    (same number of rows and same number of columns).
  - Each element of the result matrix C is the sum of the corresponding
    elements from A and B.
  - Formula:  C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j]

  Example:
    A = | 1  2 |    B = | 5  6 |    A + B = | 1+5  2+6 |   = | 6   8 |
        | 3  4 |        | 7  8 |            | 3+7  4+8 |     | 10 12 |

Matrix Subtraction:
  - Same rule — matrices must have identical dimensions.
  - Each element of the result matrix C is the difference of the
    corresponding elements from A and B.
  - Formula:  C[i][j] = A[i][j] - B[i][j]

  Example:
    A = | 5  6 |    B = | 1  2 |    A - B = | 5-1  6-2 |   = | 4  4 |
        | 7  8 |        | 3  4 |            | 7-3  8-4 |     | 4  4 |


----- 3. LOGIC OF THE CODE -----

Step 1: Check if both matrices have the same dimensions (rows & columns).
        If NOT, throw an error — operation is not possible.

Step 2: Create a new result matrix of the same size.

Step 3: Use two nested loops to go through every row (i) and column (j):
          - For Addition:    result[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j]
          - For Subtraction: result[i][j] = A[i][j] - B[i][j]

Step 4: Return the result matrix.

Time Complexity: O(rows × cols) — we visit each element exactly once.


----- 4. CODE & FUNCTION EXPLANATION -----

>> operator+ (Addition) — defined in Matrix.cpp

    Matrix Matrix::operator+(const Matrix &other) const {
      if (rows != other.rows || cols != other.cols) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("Matrix dimensions must match for addition");
      }
      Matrix result(rows, cols);
      for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
          result.data[i][j] = data[i][j] + other.data[i][j];
        }
      }
      return result;
    }

  Explanation:
  - "operator+" lets us write  C = A + B  directly in code.
  - Line 1: We check that A and B have the same rows and columns.
            If not, it throws an error message.
  - Line 2: We create a new empty matrix "result" with the same size.
  - Lines 3-5: Two nested for-loops iterate over every element.
               Each result element = sum of corresponding A and B elements.
  - Line 6: The completed result matrix is returned.


>> operator- (Subtraction) — defined in Matrix.cpp

    Matrix Matrix::operator-(const Matrix &other) const {
      if (rows != other.rows || cols != other.cols) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("Matrix dimensions must match for subtraction");
      }
      Matrix result(rows, cols);
      for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
          result.data[i][j] = data[i][j] - other.data[i][j];
        }
      }
      return result;
    }

  Explanation:
  - Identical structure to addition, only difference is the minus (-) sign.
  - Same dimension check, same nested loops, but subtracts instead of adds.


>> matrixAddSubtract() — defined in main.cpp (the menu function)

    void matrixAddSubtract() {
      // Shows sub-menu: 1. Addition  2. Subtraction
      // Reads user's choice
      // Takes input for Matrix A and Matrix B
      // Calls A + B or A - B based on choice
      // Displays Matrix A, Matrix B, and the Result
    }

  Explanation:
  - This is the user-facing function that ties everything together.
  - It asks the user to pick Addition or Subtraction.
  - It takes both matrices as input (rows, cols, then elements row by row).
  - It calls the operator+ or operator- function accordingly.
  - Finally, it displays all three matrices (A, B, and Result).
  - If the dimensions don't match, it catches the error and shows a message.


----- 5. SUMMARY -----

  - Addition and Subtraction require matrices of the SAME dimensions.
  - We use C++ operator overloading (operator+, operator-) for clean syntax.
  - Nested loops handle element-wise computation in O(rows × cols) time.
  - Error handling ensures invalid inputs are caught gracefully.

Thank you for your attention!
