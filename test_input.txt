# Matrix Calculator - Quick Test Examples

## Test 1: Simple 2×2 Matrix Operations with Fractions

### Input for Addition/Subtraction:
```
Matrix A (2×2):
1/2 1/3
1/4 1/5

Matrix B (2×2):
1/6 1/7
1/8 1/9
```

### Input for Determinant:
```
2 2
4 2
3 1
```
Expected: det = -2

### Input for RREF (Fraction Example):
```
2 3
1/2 1/3 1/4
1/5 1/6 1/7
```

## Test 2: 3×3 Identity Matrix
```
3 3
1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1
```
Determinant should be 1
Inverse should be itself

## Test 3: Linear Independence
```
3 3
1 2 3
0 1 2
0 0 1
```
Should be linearly independent (rank = 3)

## Usage Tips
- Enter fractions as `1/2`, `3/4`, etc.
- Enter integers as `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.
- Max matrix size: 5×5
- Results display as exact fractions (no decimals!)

## Run the Program
```bash
cd d:\Programming\proj_scratch  
.\main_fraction.exe
```
